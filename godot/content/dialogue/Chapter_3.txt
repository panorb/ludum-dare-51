Story:

Narrator:
    As you come closer to the light to the end of the tunnel...
    a wide wasteland stretches from your feet to the horizon, drenched in the night sky's cold and unforgiving light.
    Only two specks of light emit among the various buildings in front of you.
    Next to an abandonded village a few hundred meters ahead lies a massive mansion...
    massive and silent, its windows shedding light into the darkness like judging eyes.
    Further down the road there erects a tower upon a hill...
    a mysterious aura makes it clear that is indeed not abandoned.

VisitedPlaces:
    0 = none
    1 = Villa

        Gandalf:
            I've heard stories about the wretched creature that lives inside these halls...
            A vampire whose horrors led these villages to be abandoned!
            i do not want to deal with this. i want people to enjoy the wonders of magic, not draw my last breath.
        QTE: convince Gandalf
            success:
                Gandalf:
                    If anything happens to me, this is your responsibility!
                if Davidpresent == true
                    David:
                        Don't worry knucklehead, my trusty slingshot will save your enchanted buttocks if worse comes to worst.
            fail:
                Gandalf:
                    Fine, you fools! If you insist, I will not parttake in your madness.

    Narrator:
        The smell of dusty curtains and rotten floorboards crawls into your noses...
        Scattered, sad-looking candles illuminate the staircase.
        Suddenly, you notice a creepy shadow being thrown at the wall next to you.
        You turn around to run, but the path to the door is blocked.
    Drakula:
        Guests? I did not expect guests!
    Narrator:
        A shiver runs down your spine as you hear the creature's scratchy voice.
    Drakula:
        I would have served pastries and tea if only i had known!
    if Davidpresent == true
        David:
            Stand back, or I- I'll shoot!
    else
        Alex:
            Is this meant to be a sadistic inuendo? I won't have it!
    Drakula:
        Please, not in this harsh tone! I'm tired of all the hatred...
        I do not mean you any harm.
    Narrator:
        The shadowy figure reveals itself from the darkness...
        and a tall, well-dressed man with pale skin stands in front of you.
    if Davidpresent == true
        Narrator:
            You hear the leather of David's slingshot stretch, in anticipation of a well-aimed shot at the man infront of you.
        QTE: stop David from shooting
            success:
                Alex:
                    David, let's hear him out at the very least!
                    If he wanted us dead, you would not be aiming at him at this very moment.
            fail:
                Narrator:
                    David's projectile whizzes through the thin air, and hits its mark.
                Drakula:
                    HYAAAGGHH!
                Narrator:
                    The tall man bolted, and as quickly as he blocked your path, he vanished into the darkness.
                    His bloodcurdling screatch sent you into fight-or-flight, and you dashed ahead with the path to the outside cleared.
    Alex:
        Who are you? I'm sorry for disturbing this late into the night...
        But we are in dire need for assistance. And there isn't much time left...
        literally.
    Drakula:
        Just a lonely vampire... But do not be afraid!
        I hurt no man. I restricted myself to a diet of animal blood.
        The villagers did not give me a chance to speak.
        They blamed their bruises and diseases on my presence...
        and now continue their short-sighted life elsewhere.
    Choice: Do you believe his story?
        1 Everyone deserves a second chance. We need all the help we can get
        2 No way in hell would we shake hands with a murderer!.

        Drakula:
            Oh adventurer! Thank you for your hindsight. I will not disappoint you.
        if Gandalfpresent == true
            Drakula:
                I see you brought the wizard.
                Is he the one illuminating the night sky with his spectacular magic?
                I am honored to meet you, uuh..
            Gandalf:
                G-Gandalf. Nice to meet you.
            Narrator:
                The wizard blushed, but noone saw it happen in the darkness.
        Narrator:
            You left the mansion confidently with increased manpower.

    if Drakulapresent == false and Gandalfpresent == false and VisitedPlaces == 3
        Narrator:
            as you defeatedly exit the mansion through the creaking doors, a rustling in the bushes reveals a person's presence:
        Gandalf:
            A-are you alone? Yes? I knew you'd know to stay away from foul abominations like him!
            There is no reason for me not to join you anymore. Let me tag along!
        Choice: How do we deal with this scaredy-cat?
            1 Accept that you were wrong, and take Gandalf back
            2 He made his choice, he obviously lacks the resolve for the journey ahead
        1
            Gandalf:
                Thank you!
            Narrator:
                And thus, the adventurers continued with a magical companion.
        2
            Gandalf:
                I didn't want to side with you anyways! You will get yourself killed wherever you are going.
            Narrator:
                You parted ways with the wizard...
                and as your feet take you elsewhere, you can see his magic illuminating the path in front of you.

Male Ninja Aelrin
    thinks that Lilith neglected cattle since it looks malnourished from the vampire's feasts

Narrator:
    You enter the village inhabited by ninjas.
    It is exactly as Drakula described, rivers flowing through huts with curved, crimson-red roofs.
    You would love to stay in this idyllic place, but the realization of your duty snaps you back into reality.
    Past a few houses you hear a two of the inhabitants arguing.
    A man blames a woman for neglecting their livestock.
Aelrin:
    Just look at them! How is it not clear that something is wrong with our cattle?
Narrator:
    The woman stays silent, you can tell she had cried.
    As you approach them, she quickly wipes her tears off.
Lilith:
    Who are you? W.. What are you doing here?
Aelrin:
    Don't try and distract from your shortcomings!
    You know we rely on these animals.
Lilith:
    I swear I don't know why they are like this...
    Do you think I haven't poured my heart into caring for these animals?
    Seeing them falling ill one by one breaks my heart...
    And you left me for this? When I needed you most?
Narrator:
    You wait for two to finish arguing.
Alex:
    Actually, we are here to inquire for help.
    Life as we know it is at risk. Soon your issues will be null in comparison for what's to come.
Narrator:
    As you tell them about the incoming danger, you see Drakula acting uneasy.
    His stomach is growling and he's eyeing the cattle.
    You realize what was going on, but you have to stop him now.
QTE: Stop Drakula without drawing attention to yourself
    success:
        Narrator:
            You successfully hold him back.
            The ex-lovers listen carefully and haven't noticed a thing.
        Aelrin:
            Of course I will help! At least someone should be able to care for these people.
        Narrator:
            He shoots Lilith a nasty look.
        Lilith:
            If he's set on coming with you, there's no way I will come with!
            Your loss. His blunt blade won't compare to my skills.
        Aelrin:
            Have you forgotten who taught you to throw your shuriken?
            You would be nothing without me!
        Lilith:
            You're right! And because you left me, every day feels emptier than the last.
        Narrator:
            You feel the need to clear up the misunderstanding that is only obvious to you and your companions.
            Just as you began to raise your voice, realization struck you.
            You need their help to fuel the fight, to raise the odds just ever so slightly.
            If you were honest, they might choose to rebuild their relationship.
            You know all too well that you can't expect them to fight two heart-wrenching battles at once.
        Choice:
            1 Tell the truth and leave them behind.
            2 Keep the lie going for a little longer.
        1
            Narrator:
                You decide not to involve them in the fight.
                As you explain the matters, Drakula profusely apologizing...
                their faces reflect a mixture of relief and regret.
                They fall into each others arms, and you feel like they need some time alone.
            --> Ende ohne Ninjas
        2
            Narrator:
                You decide that there will be plenty opportunities for this storm to clear up after the time thief's threat is banned from this world.
            Alex:
                We need your help, now more than ever.
            Aelrin:
                Then let's go!
            Lilith:
                Wait a minute! He hasn't even told us who would be going with them.
            Aelrin:
                Well it's either you or me, that's for sure. Now, Alex?
            Choice:
                1 Aelrin
                2 Lilith
            1
                Aelrin:
                    I will not disappoint you. Dire times require strong fighters.
                Narrator:
                    You leave the village with Aelrin's blade having your back.
            2
                Narrator:
                    With a smug face, Lilith turns her back towards Aelrin and follows you.
                Lilith:
                    I needed this so much. I don't even care anymore, I have found my calling.
                Narrator:
                    You have a creeping suspicion that she cares more than she allows herself to say.
                    Regardless, the path ahead will be accompanied with the precise strikes of Lilith's throwing stars.
    fail:
        Aelrin:
            What is he doing? Stop this guy!
        Narrator:
            It did not take them very long at all to catch onto the truth.
        Lilith:
            I knew there was more at play! Stop this monstrocity!
        Narrator:
            Their blades and throwing stars combined had almost cost you your life...
            but you all manage to escape their righteous fury.
            You begin to think that they should have learned the truth another way.
            But there is no going back.
